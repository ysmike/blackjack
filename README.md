# Blackjack (1v1)

## Plan of attack
- Think about what states to keep track of and components & constants to create
- Gather API endpoints to be used and store in `constants.js`
- Write logic for grabbing the deck and drawing cards from the API
- Implement buttons to hit and stand
- Set the drawn cards to state and calculate running score
- Display win/lose/continue status
- Arrange, resize, and style components
- Write tests (time permitting)
